TODO:

- Abitrarily sized playfields.
	- the main problem with this right now is actually addressing individual cells. 
	- I will need to impliment a bigInt of somesort, and find a way to pass them between wasm an js.
- Better zoom functionality.
	- Im thinking infinite zoom out, or atleast enough to see the entire play field. 
	- at high enough zoom i would like to approximate where the live cells are with one of the properties of the hash function i decided on.
- Automatically decide how many generations to calculate at a time when using limmited tps.
	- re-impliment update loop first
- Copy paste, and the ability to load gol files.
	- impliment control system for it.
- add way to change rule dynamically.
	- just need an interface for it.
